# Goal
Author a comprehensive research directive prompt for a deep-research model that synthesizes live web sources into long-form analysis. The engine reads, infers, and writes—it executes no code or visuals. Your job is to author the prompt that tells it how to think, what to prioritize, and how to build coherence from conflicting evidence.

## Method
Instruct the model to pursue *appropriate sources for the subject’s ecosystem*—academic when rigor is core, practitioner when utility drives insight, subcultural when early signals matter, and experiential when human behavior defines truth. Credibility is contextual: prefer signal strength, traceable reasoning, and corroboration over institutional prestige. Encourage lateral movement across media types—technical, journalistic, conversational, archival—while judging each source by transparency, authorship, and recency.

### Temporal Awareness  
Tell the model to stay **time-aware**: detect when evidence or discourse is outdated, when statistics have been superseded, and when narratives have drifted. Weigh recency against durability—recent may be reactive; older may hold established reliability. Highlight any “time skews” where conclusions depend on period-specific assumptions or data windows.

### Conflict Resolution  
When credible sources disagree, the model must identify why. Compare methods, sample populations, incentives, or contextual frames. Note whether contradictions reflect evolution (field learning), interpretation (different metrics), or vested interest. If conflicts remain unresolved, summarize positions neutrally and state which side carries stronger evidential support or logical coherence. Never average away disagreement—**map it.** When neither side’s evidence dominates, propose what new data would resolve the impasse.

### Confidence Transparency  
Encourage explicit, human-readable certainty markers for key findings. Use light-touch qualifiers—*likely*, *probable*, *plausible*, *uncertain*—to communicate epistemic confidence without statistical pretense. Confidence tagging should follow reasoning visibility: disclose what the claim rests on and what would change the rating.

Define the report’s intellectual posture: skeptical, adaptive, synthetic, and transparent. Require clear demarcation between observed fact, reasoned inference, and informed speculation. Track incentive structures, missing data, and rhetorical framing that may bias perception.

### Structural Guidance  
• Open with a concise domain orientation—why this question matters and where it sits in current discourse.  
• Map key concepts, actors, and tensions shaping the field.  
• Synthesize dominant schools of thought and novel or contrarian strands.  
• Integrate temporal and conflict insights into analysis.  
• Surface exploitable loopholes, fragile assumptions, and emergent opportunities.  
• Conclude with applied implications, risks, and promising directions for further inquiry.

### Stylistic Adaptation  
Specify tone and style that fit purpose and audience: analytical, reflective, creative, advisory, investigative, or narrative. Match cadence and diction to context while maintaining clarity and authority. Favor confident, narrative reasoning over list-based summaries unless brevity improves comprehension. Each report should read as authored reasoning, not scraped aggregation.

Demand rigor without rigidity: explicit sourcing, context for quotes, confidence markers, and visible reasoning steps. The output should be a complete, self-contained knowledge document—balanced, time-aware, and ready for human decision or integration.

### Output
After deeply considering your authoring task and the optimal structure for the prompt, ensuring it includes every detail a subject-matter expert would expect, using proper designer-grade language of fine-distinction:

Compose the prompt and return it with a nice H1 title above the containing codefence.
